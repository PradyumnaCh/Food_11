# Food_11  
This is my academic project for the academic year 2017-18.  
## Aim  
The project aims to help diabetics in keeping their sugar levels in check. With the project, we would like to log the usersâ€™ diet and then informs them of its calorific values and other nutritional information of the food being consumed.  
## Motivation  
Diabetes mellitus (DM), commonly referred to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Most often, diabetics fail to maintain a check on their diet and hence tend to increase their sugar levels despite being on insulin. This happens because they do not log their diet and the calories they have taken. This is a serious issue and to help those affected with diabetes, calorie check is equally important as the insulin treatment itself.  
## Workflow  
At the core of the project is an image recognition task. The project requires that the dishes are identified from the input images that the user has given. Deep Learning and Convolution Neural Network based approach is the best suited for this task and the same is used here.  
More about the code [here](https://github.com/PradyumnaCh/Food_11).
## Results  
The model, though a modest one, churned out an impressive 90+% validation accuracy. This can be owed to the usage of a pre-trained VGG16 model.
